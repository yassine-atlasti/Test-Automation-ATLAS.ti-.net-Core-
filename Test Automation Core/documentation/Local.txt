1. **Configure local variables related to your environnement :**

#### 'local-config' Folder

This folder contains classes with variables related to the running machine , such as OneDrive Path, WinAppDriver Path. 
We could add this Folder in the .gitignore 
- **'AtlastiConfig.cs'**: Sepcifies the installation Path of ATLAS.ti
- **`WinAppDriverConfig.cs`**: Specifies the file path of `winappdriver.exe`.
Ensure this path is correctly set to the WinAppDriverVar.cs executable.

- **`OneDriveConfig.cs`**: Configure the OneDrive path of the testing system here. It's actually done automatically, 
but if your OneDrive is running on another machine and you're using volume mapping set the path manually.
This is crucial for accessing test projects and libraries stored on OneDrive.

#### `onedrive` Folder

Note:
Before starting Tests which requires Data (like CH Projects , 
or Smoke Test Libraries) make Sure your OneDrive Testing Stuff is up to date, 

To avoid downloading data during test runs, keep the Folders needed for tests always on your local OneDrive :

\Testing stuff\Test Data\Smoke Tests data\Win\Smoke Test Libraries
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Win\current Windows Release A23
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Win\current Windows Release A22
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Mac\current Mac Release A22
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Mac\current Mac Release A23
