### Data Management
- Manage test data in `test/resources/test-data`.

### Overview
Test data management is critical for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of automated smoke tests. 
The framework uses various data files located in the `test-data` directory, each serving a specific purpose 
in the testing process.





#### `onedrive/projects`

- **`test\resources\test-data\onedrive\projects\CHProjects.cs`**: Contains file paths for the projects used in smoke tests.

#### `onedrive/libraries`
- **test\resources\test-data\onedrive\projects\SmokeTestLibraries.cs`**: Defines the paths for smoke test libraries. 

The projects and libraries paths are mostly retrieved automatically and stored in the variables.



2. **Before Each Smoke Test:**
   - Verify that your OneDrive sync is up to date, and the CH current Production Projects are updated 
  
  - Crucially update `test\resources\test-data\atlasti\AtlasVariables.cs` with the latest ATLAS.ti version information. 
   This includes updating the Windows RC Version, the Windows production version, Mac production version, 
   and previous major versions.
    

### Best Practices

- **Regular Checks:** Frequently review and update test data files to ensure they reflect the current testing requirements.
- **Version Control:** Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes in test data files, making it easier to revert
to previous configurations if needed.
- **Documentation:** Keep inline documentation in the `.cs` files up to date, explaining the purpose of each variable and 
path.
