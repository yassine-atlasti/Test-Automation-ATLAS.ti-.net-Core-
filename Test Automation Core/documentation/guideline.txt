# ATLAS.ti Test Automation Framework Usage Guideline with WinAppDriver

## Introduction
Welcome to the ATLAS.ti Test Automation Framework, designed to automate smoke testing using WinAppDriver. 
This document will guide you through the installation, configuration, and usage of the framework.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11.
- ATLAS.ti (compatible version).
- .NET Core 
- WinAppDriver.
- Git
- Visual Studio
- One Drive (for test data in Testing Stuff)

### Installation and Setup
1. **Install ATLAS.ti:** Ensure ATLAS.ti is installed on your system. 
2. ** Install Visual Studio
3. **Install .NET Core SDK:** 
4. **Set Up WinAppDriver:** Install WinAppDriver from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver).
5. **Install Git on your machine**
6. **Clone the Framework Repository:** Run the following command from the directory where you want to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yassine-atlasti/Test-Automation-ATLAS.ti-.net-Core-.git
   ```
7. **Start WinAppDriver:** Launch WinAppDriver from its installation directory, 
usually at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Application Driver\WinAppDriver.exe`. 
Go to WinAppDriverConfig.cs and adjust the path if needed

## Framework Overview

### Architecture
Utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) for organizing UI interaction scripts, enhancing maintainability.

### Project Structure
- **`src` Directory:** Contains page implementation.
  - `pages`: POM scripts for ATLAS.ti UI components.
- **`test` Directory:** Test cases, suites, data, and configurations.
  - `resources`: Test data and configurations.
  - `main`: Main test scripts and utilities.

- **`bin` and `obj` Directories:** Build outputs and .NET managed directories. (Not under version control)

## Writing Test Cases

### Structure and Implementation
- Test cases are organized under `test/main/tests`.
- Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for clarity.

### 
### Data Management
- Manage test data in `test/resources/test-data`.

### Overview
Test data management is critical for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of automated smoke tests. 
The framework uses various data files located in the `test-data` directory, each serving a specific purpose 
in the testing process.

### Directory Structure and Key Files

#### 'local-config' Folder

This folder contains classes with variables related to the running machine , such as OneDrive Path, WinAppDriver Path. 
We could add this Folder in the .gitignore 
- **'AtlastiConfig.cs'**: Sepcifies the installation Path of ATLAS.ti
- **`WinAppDriverConfig.cs`**: Specifies the file path of `winappdriver.exe`.
Ensure this path is correctly set to the WinAppDriverVar.cs executable.

- **`OneDriveConfig.cs`**: Configure the OneDrive path of the testing system here. It's actually done automatically, 
but if your OneDrive is running on another machine and you're using volume mapping set the path manually.
This is crucial for accessing test projects and libraries stored on OneDrive.

#### `onedrive` Folder

Note:
Before starting Tests which requires Data (like CH Projects , 
or Smoke Test Libraries) make Sure your OneDrive Testing Stuff is up to date, 

To avoid downloading data during test runs, keep the Folders needed for tests always on your local OneDrive :

\Testing stuff\Test Data\Smoke Tests data\Win\Smoke Test Libraries
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Win\current Windows Release A23
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Win\current Windows Release A22
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Mac\current Mac Release A22
\Testing stuff\Test Data\Projects\C&H all versions\Mac\current Mac Release A23


#### `onedrive/projects`
- **`CHProjects.cs`**: Contains file paths for the projects used in smoke tests.

#### `onedrive/libraries`
- **`SmokeTestLibraries.cs`**: Defines the paths for smoke test libraries. 

#### `smoketestdata`
- **`SmokeTestVariables.cs`**: This file contains variables specific to smoke tests, like the current Windows OS version. 
Review and update these variables to reflect the current testing environment.


#### `atlasti`
- **`AtlasVariables.cs`**: Critical for specifying versions of ATLAS.ti under test, including Windows and Mac production 
versions, previous major versions, and the version under test. Update these before each smoke test to align with
the version being tested.

### Updating Test Data

1. **After Each Change in the Structure of the used OneDrive Folders:**
   - Ensure all paths in  `CHProjects.cs`, and `SmokeTestLibraries.cs` accurately reflect
   the current locations of test files. 
   If something is wrong in the file paths, you will get an error when running the corresponding tests.

   - Verify that your OneDrive sync is up to date

2. **Before Each Smoke Test:**
   - In `SmokeTestVariables.cs`, check and update relevant variables.
   - Crucially update `AtlasVariables.cs` with the latest ATLAS.ti version information. 
   This includes updating the Windows RC Version, the Windows production version, Mac production version, 
   and previous major versions.
    .

### Best Practices

- **Regular Checks:** Frequently review and update test data files to ensure they reflect the current testing requirements.
- **Version Control:** Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes in test data files, making it easier to revert
to previous configurations if needed.
- **Documentation:** Keep inline documentation in the `.cs` files up to date, explaining the purpose of each variable and 
path.

### Assertions
- Use NUnit assertions to validate test results.

## Executing Tests

### Running Tests
- Use Visual Studio's Test Explorer or `dotnet test` for execution.
- For specific suites: `dotnet test --filter TestCategory=YourCategory`.
- For example to run the smoke Test Suite, you need to find SmokeTestSuite.cs class, right-click it and click on run tests.
